The intersection of **Low-Code Automation** and **Generative AI** is where the magic happens in modern IT operations. By combining **n8n** (a workflow automation tool) with **ChatGPT** (OpenAI's LLM), we can build intelligent workflows that go far beyond simple "if-this-then-that" logic.

At **143IT**, we've been deploying these AI-powered workflows to help MSPs and IT departments reduce manual toil and improve response times.

## Why n8n + ChatGPT?

- **n8n**: Provides the connectivity. It talks to your ticketing system (Jira, ServiceNow), your chat platform (Slack, Teams), and your email.
- **ChatGPT**: Provides the intelligence. It can understand natural language, summarize text, classify issues, and generate responses.

## Use Case 1: Intelligent Ticket Classification

One of the biggest time sinks for service desks is triage. Reading a ticket, deciding which team it belongs to, and assigning priority takes time.

### The Workflow
1. **Trigger**: New ticket created in Jira/Zendesk.
2. **Action**: n8n sends the ticket description to ChatGPT.
3. **Prompt**: "Analyze this IT support ticket. Classify it into one of these categories: [Network, Hardware, Software, Access]. Suggest a priority level (Low, Medium, High) based on urgency."
4. **Action**: n8n updates the ticket with the suggested category and priority.

### The Impact
- **90% reduction** in triage time.
- **Consistent categorization** for better reporting.
- **Faster routing** to the correct support team.

## Use Case 2: Automated First-Line Support

For common issues like password resets or software installation requests, AI can provide immediate assistance.

### The Workflow
1. **Trigger**: User sends a message in Slack channel `#it-support`.
2. **Action**: n8n checks if the message is a question.
3. **Action**: n8n sends the question to ChatGPT, armed with a knowledge base context.
4. **Prompt**: "You are an IT support assistant. Answer this user's question using the following documentation context: [Insert KB Article]. If the answer isn't in the context, advise them to open a ticket."
5. **Action**: n8n posts the AI response back to Slack.

## Use Case 3: Meeting Summarization & Action Items

Stop worrying about taking notes during incident post-mortems or planning meetings.

### The Workflow
1. **Trigger**: Meeting recording transcript becomes available (e.g., from Zoom or Teams).
2. **Action**: n8n chunks the transcript and sends it to ChatGPT.
3. **Prompt**: "Summarize this meeting transcript. List key decisions made and extract all action items with their assignees."
4. **Action**: n8n creates tasks in your project management tool and emails the summary to attendees.

## Building Your First Workflow

Here is a simple JSON structure for an n8n node that calls OpenAI:

```javascript
// OpenAI Node Configuration in n8n
{
  "resource": "chat",
  "operation": "create",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful IT assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "={{ $json.ticket_description }}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

When integrating AI into IT workflows, security is paramount:

1. **Data Privacy**: Sanitize PII (Personally Identifiable Information) before sending data to OpenAI.
2. **Human in the Loop**: For sensitive actions (like granting access), always require human approval.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement safeguards to prevent runaway costs.

## Conclusion

The combination of n8n and ChatGPT allows IT teams to build "cognitive automation" — workflows that can read, understand, and make decisions. This frees up your human experts to focus on complex, high-value problems.
