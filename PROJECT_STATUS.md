- **docker-test.sh** - Automated testing script

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Quick start
docker-compose up -d

# Or use npm scripts
npm run docker:compose:up
npm run docker:compose:logs
npm run docker:compose:down

# Manual build
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run
```

### Deployment Tested On

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Pending Features

### Critical / Launch Blocking
1. **Production n8n validation**
   - **Location**: `app/api/product-demo/route.ts`, contact/newsletter APIs
   - **Issue**: Real production webhook delivery, durable storage, notification routing, and failure handling still need end-to-end evidence
   - **Action Required**: Test with approved production n8n workflows

2. **Product security/support/legal approvals**
   - **Issue**: Security & Trust, Product Support, terms, and privacy pages include draft/factual disclosures but still require architecture, business, operational, and legal approval before launch commitments are final
   - **Action Required**: Approve RBAC model, tenant isolation evidence, support/SLA policy, DPA/subprocessors, and final legal terms

3. **OpenAI API Key Security**
   - **Location**: `.env.local`
   - **Recommendation**: Rotate API key before production deployment
   - **Add**: Rate limiting to `/api/chat` endpoint to prevent abuse

4. **Image Remote Patterns Too Permissive**
   - **Location**: `next.config.mjs:26`
   - **Issue**: Wildcard hostname (`**`) allows ALL external images
   - **Risk**: Potential SSRF vulnerability
   - **Fix**: Restrict to specific trusted domains

### Integration Points Ready for Setup
1. **Newsletter** → n8n webhook
2. **Analytics** → Add Fathom/Plausible tracking code
3. **Blog CMS** → Connect to Notion API/Ghost/WordPress

### Placeholders to Replace
- Author avatars (currently using default icons)
- Real sanitized Azure VM Manager screenshots
- Exact product support/SLA and pricing terms after approval

### Configuration Notes
- **npm start warning**: Shows warning due to `output: 'standalone'` config, but works. Use `npm run dev` for development or Docker for production.
- **Environment Setup**: Must copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add OpenAI API key before running
