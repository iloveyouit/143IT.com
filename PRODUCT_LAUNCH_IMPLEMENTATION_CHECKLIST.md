# 143IT Website Remediation and Product Launch Checklist

**Product:** Azure VM Manager  
**Source:** `143IT-Website-to-Product-Launch-Roadmap.md`  
**Working rule:** Complete and verify one checklist item at a time. Do not publish claims, pricing, security details, or legal language until the responsible owner approves them.

## Status Key

- [ ] Not started
- [x] Complete
- **Blocked by:** A decision or prerequisite required before implementation
- **Evidence:** Link to the PR, screenshot, test output, analytics event, or approval that proves completion

## Launch Decisions

These decisions should be resolved first because they affect multiple implementation tasks.

### D-01 — Choose the product pricing model

- [x] Use a hybrid pricing model: a base monthly organization/tenant license with included users, Azure subscriptions, and VM capacity; additional users and infrastructure capacity are plan limits or add-ons.
- [ ] Define plans, prices, billing frequency, included usage, overages, taxes, cancellation, and refund policy.
- [x] Use sales-assisted pricing at launch. Explain the hybrid pricing structure publicly, but display “Contact us for pricing” instead of dollar amounts.
- **Decision recorded:** July 8, 2026
- **Owner:** Product + Business
- **Blocks:** P1-03, P1-04, P2-03
- **Done when:** A written pricing specification is approved for publication.

### D-02 — Choose the launch conversion path

- [x] Use a staged v1 conversion path: request a demo first, followed by an assisted trial for qualified customers.
- [x] Demo form fields: name, work email, company, job role, number of Azure subscriptions, approximate number of VMs, primary challenge/message, and optional phone number.
- [x] Assisted-trial qualification requires a business email and an active Azure subscription. Trials are manually approved after the demo; no minimum VM count is required at launch.
- [x] After submission, show: “Your request has been received. A 143IT product specialist will contact you within one business day to schedule your demo.”
- [x] Send new demo-request notifications through n8n to `support@143it.com`; that inbox owns the initial response and routing.
- [x] Commit to an initial response within one business day.
- [x] Route demo submissions through n8n. Configure an approved webhook, durable destination, internal notification, and failed-delivery handling during implementation.
- **Decision recorded:** July 8, 2026
- **Owner:** Product + Sales + Web
- **Blocks:** P1-04, P3-01, P3-05
- **Done when:** The complete visitor-to-onboarding workflow is documented.

### D-03 — Approve the case-study strategy

- [x] Remove the existing generic/fabricated-looking case studies and replace them with one truthful story about why and how 143IT built Azure VM Manager.
- [ ] Record which existing pages and links will be removed, redirected, or rewritten.
- [x] Add real customer case studies later only with consent and verified results.
- **Decision recorded:** July 8, 2026
- **Owner:** Product + Content
- **Blocks:** P0-02, P3-02
- **Done when:** The replacement strategy and permitted evidence are approved.

### D-04 — Confirm product architecture and onboarding

- [x] Use Azure Container Apps for the production API and background worker, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server for persistence, managed identities and Key Vault for identity/secrets, and Application Insights plus Log Analytics for observability.
- [x] Current runtime is a containerized API.
- [x] Current Azure VM operations execute directly in the API process; there is no separate background worker.
- [x] Move long-running Azure VM operations to a queue-backed worker before production launch. The API will accept and record requests, enqueue work, return an operation ID, and expose status; the worker will execute actions and record progress, retries, and audit results.
- [x] Use Azure Service Bus between the API and background worker.
- [ ] Define retry, timeout, idempotency, duplicate-detection, dead-letter, poison-message, and cancellation behavior.
- [ ] Confirm authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation.
- [ ] Confirm Azure onboarding and RBAC assignment workflow.
- [ ] Confirm trial provisioning, expiration, suspension, and deletion behavior.
- [ ] Confirm billing integration, if applicable.
- **Current architecture recorded:** July 8, 2026
- **Owner:** Product + DevOps
- **Blocks:** P1-01, P1-04, P2-01, P2-03
- **Done when:** The website can describe onboarding and security without assumptions.

### D-05 — Approve support commitments

- [ ] Define support channels and coverage hours.
- [ ] Define severity levels and target response times.
- [ ] Define uptime target, maintenance windows, exclusions, and service-credit policy.
- [ ] Confirm which commitments can be operationally supported.
- **Owner:** Product + Business
- **Blocks:** P2-02
- **Done when:** A product-specific support and SLA specification is approved.

### D-06 — Select analytics and privacy approach

- [ ] Choose the analytics provider.
- [ ] Define required consent and cookie behavior.
- [ ] Define data retention and access ownership.
- [ ] Name the dashboard owner.
- **Owner:** Product + Web + Legal
- **Blocks:** P3-01
- **Done when:** The measurement plan is approved and compatible with the Privacy Policy.

### D-07 — Assign owners and legal reviewer

- [ ] Replace role placeholders with named owners.
- [ ] Select internal or external legal counsel.
- [ ] Establish legal-review turnaround and approval evidence.
- **Owner:** Product
- **Blocks:** All phases
- **Done when:** Every task has an accountable person and legal work has an assigned reviewer.

- [x] Audit homepage, About page, Pillars, service cards, chatbot responses, and service-detail pages for broad MSP support language such as “24/7 monitoring & support.”
- [x] Rewrite broad support language so it is clearly scoped to approved MSP services and does not imply Azure VM Manager product support targets, uptime commitments, or SLA coverage.

- [x] Verify that product pages, service pages, homepage, About page, and chatbot copy do not blur MSP service commitments with product support commitments.
- **Resolved findings:** `app/about/page.tsx`, `components/Pillars.tsx`, `components/ChatBot.tsx`, `app/api/chat/route.ts`, and `README.md` were updated to remove broad “24/7”/phone-number language from public launch surfaces.
