# Azure VM Manager Analytics Event Plan

**Status:** Provider-neutral implementation plan  
**Updated:** July 9, 2026  
**Scope:** Public website and demo-request funnel only

## Rules

- Do not send names, email addresses, phone numbers, company names, tenant IDs, subscription IDs, VM names, IP addresses, message text, or free-form form content to analytics.
- Use stable, low-cardinality event names and properties.
- Do not enable analytics that sets non-essential cookies until the analytics provider and consent model are approved.
- Treat this document as the implementation contract regardless of whether the selected provider is Plausible, Fathom, Google Analytics, PostHog, Application Insights, or another tool.

## Implementation Notes

- Add a small analytics wrapper after the provider and consent model are selected.
- Default behavior should be no-op when analytics is disabled.
- Keep events resilient: analytics failures must never block form submission.
- Record provider configuration and dashboard owner in `PRODUCT_LAUNCH_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` after D-06 is resolved.
